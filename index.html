            <h2>About them</h2>
            <p>
                The Highland (Scottish Gaelic: Bò Ghàidhealach; Scots: Heilan coo) is a Scottish breed of rustic cattle.
                It originated in the Scottish Highlands and the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland and has long horns
                and a long shaggy coat.
                It is a hardy breed, bred to withstand the intemperate conditions in the region.
                The first herd-book dates from 1885; two different types – a smaller island type, usually black, and a
                larger mainland type, usually dun – were registered as a single breed.
                It is reared primarily for beef, and has been exported to several other countries
